I declare that in submitting all work for this assessment I have read, understood and agree to the content and expectations of the Assessment declaration.

Peter talked to us about arguments, which is a set of evidence giving strength to an opinion (Farell 2021).By making arguments, you convince people to believe in the idea you're proving. Teacher gave us some arguments and asked us to choose the best ones after4 minutes of thinking. The lesson was easy but some students thought it's challenging. Next, Peter brought up a common topic: Plagiarism, we learnt the
meaning of it and how to avoid it like quoting and paraphrasing. We were tasked with paraphrasing 3 long sentences to practice, this was how we learnt paraphrasing is not always easy. But when you plagiarise, you will be kicked out of the school sothe importance of referencing and paraphrasing can not be prioritize enough. I used to complete my writing before looking for author, year and information to make the reference
list. After writing, I realized some information like date, year are missing. Now I know incorrect referencing is serious. From now on, I will always look for enough information before choosing sources to prevent losing time and plagiarism. After learning how to paraphrase, we learnt about synthesizing, which is collecting same ideas from many sources and group them together (Farell 2021). Our final activity was to read some essays and try to synthesize them, we thought it was hard at first but we got some correct points and no one got all ideas. Systhesizing is a crucial tool in writing but I struggle so I will read some short blogs about engineering since I chose it as my career. I will pick a topic in engineering like how to become a good engineer and look for same ideas in these blogs. I will do 4 blogs at a time in 1 day, my goal is to extract as many similar points as possible. Then I will increase to 2 topic a day, 8 blogs and SAS will be my number 1 option to check my progress. I will see how many topics I got right today and compare to last week.
