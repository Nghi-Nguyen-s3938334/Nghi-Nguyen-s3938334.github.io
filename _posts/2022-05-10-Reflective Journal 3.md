I declare that in submitting all work for this assessment I have read, understood and agree to the content and expectations of the Assessment declaration.


Teamwork is when a group of people work together to accomplish the same objective (Owenson n. d.). Jonathan mentioned that a group gives better and faster answers than an individual. In most university projects, you will work in groups and the ability to cooperate is extremely important. I have been working alone since high school because I wanted to work out everything myself. Going to university and life, I have to learn how to work with other people because life work is harder. This means work distribution will benefit me to combat stress and standards. Some people in my class was happy because they have known each other. I personally don’t know anyone in the class, and same for a lot of students but I have no issues in meeting new people. In a team, there are 5 stages: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, Adjourning (Owenson n. d.). The first 3 stages are about getting to know about each other and the assessment, changes in attitudes, poor collaboration and through the storm, we know each other better, the ice is broken and we start helping each other. The last stages are about knowing deeper about teammates, working and feedback based on results. We were asked about our previous teamwork experience to identify what we learnt, remember challenges in the team and how did we solve conflicts. The teacher was surprised when a student answered his experience was fine like nothing big happened. We moved to conflict and how to solve them, I learnt that conflicts happen more than we think and it has harmful effects on our work. It is best to address it before it happens by talking and avoid emotions. The final activity was to do a personality test on 123test website by answering 36 questions. The result said I am a chairperson, which I disagree. A skill I have to work on is definitely cooperation. I will start by improving my social skills, I will talk more to people I don’t know, I will volunteer to take more than 1 tasks if possible and my teammates can give me feedback on my results and performance.
