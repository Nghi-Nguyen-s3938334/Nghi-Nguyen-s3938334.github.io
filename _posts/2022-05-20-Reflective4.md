I declare that in submitting all work for this assessment I have read, understood and agree to the content and expectations of the Assessment declaration.


The lesson started by an introduction into computational thinking, which is collecting input information from the problem and producing an outcome using a 4-step process (Creli 2021). I learnt that these 4 steps are breaking the problem into chunks first, then look for keys to solve the problems. When you collect everything needed then you can summarize the situation and figure out the solutions. We were asked if we had ever applied computational thinking into problem solving before. I did not answer but felt computational thinking is similar to how we solve a problem, we just divide it and complete step by step, like when I want to make cake, I have to sort out the cream, sponge, toppings as decomposition. Then the pattern to make it is the same for every cake, from mixing to baking, every cake needs that key to be an edible cake. Finally we can visualize methods, recipes, steps and make the cake. Very few students answered because the topic was quite unfamiliar. This is a new lesson for me because I have been solving problems using common sense without thinking clearly each step. Going to university and life, the problem gets bigger and more complex so from now on I will try to use computational thinking to think smaller but get bigger results. I chose a career in engineering and programming is essential, that’s why thinking like a computer will help me get through programming tasks. We then moved to programming. I learnt that we can code a website using html extension in IDE like Visual Studio Code but I don’t want to go too deep in programming, IT. Finally, we learnt about Git and Github, I found that these platforms are useful to run projects, share knowledge which is perfect for my profession. As I chose engineering and the course is coming to an end, I will start applying computational thinking into my life by focusing on breaking a problem down. I have always wanted to work with Arduino, so 3 main questions can be what IDE an Arduino uses? Where can I get one and what easy project can I do first? Then I can go online to see the similarity in people’s answers and plan my purchases and initial projects.
